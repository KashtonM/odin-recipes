    <p><h3>Image of completed cheesecake</h3></p>

    <p>This is a quick, easy, and delicious recipe for homemade cheesecake. Cheesecake is often
        seen as a daunting recipe, but it is actually quite simple. The trick to creating a perfect 
        cheesecake with no cracks is to perfect the baking process. I find the best way to do it is 
        with a water bath. This prevents the cheesecake from cracking in the oven, leaving a beautiful
        cake once completed.

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 Crumb crust recipe</li>
        <li> 3 (8oz) packages of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li> 4 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li> 1 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make crumb crust and preheat oven to 350&deg;F</li>
        <li> Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer untill fluffy and add egs, 1 at a time, then vanilla and sugar, beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated and scraping down bowl between additions.</li>
        <li>Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan. Pour filling into crust and bake in baking pan (to catch drips) in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until cake is set 3 inches from edge but center is still slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken. Let stand in baking pan on a rack 5 minutes. Leave oven on.</li>
        <li>Run a knife around top edge of cake to loosen and cool completely in springform pan on rack. (Cake will continue to set as it cools.) Chill cake, loosely covered, at least 6 hours. Remove side from pan and transfer cake to a plate. Bring to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
